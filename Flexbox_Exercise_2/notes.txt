During this challenge, I encountered difficulties in realigning and resizing the three boxes. 
It was challenging to position them correctly while maintaining a responsive and visually balanced layout.

To solve this issue, I utilized the browser's DevTools (Inspector). This tool was incredibly helpful in identifying misalignments 
and areas where adjustments were needed. By inspecting the elements and tweaking the CSS properties in real time, I was able to 
fine-tune the layout efficiently.

Overall, the assignment took me approximately 1-2 hours to complete. Through this process, I reinforced my understanding 
of Flexbox properties and debugging techniques, which will be valuable for future web development projects.
